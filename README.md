# YPT Web (YeolPumTa Web Timer)

YPT Web is a browser-based study timer inspired by the YeolPumTa app. It helps students track time spent on different subjects, switch between them seamlessly, and monitor total study time – all in a clean, distraction-free web interface.

## 🌟 Features

- 🕒 Live total timer (auto-updates with all subjects)
